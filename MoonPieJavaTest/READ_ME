Only the coverage for g1.MoonPie.clientServer.receiveMessages, g1.MoonPie.clientServer, 
g1.MoonPie.clientServer.sendMessages, g1.MoonPie.clientServer.receiveMessages, and g1.MoonPie.Model should be considered for code coverage
because the other files are almost exactly the same as Professor Heineman's code and therefore are not our responsibility to test.
